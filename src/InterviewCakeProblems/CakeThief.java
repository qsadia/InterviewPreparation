/*
 * You are a renowned thief who has recently switched from stealing
 * precious metals to stealing cakes because of the insane profit margins.
 * You end up hitting the jackpot, breaking into the world's largest
 * privately owned stock of cakesâ€”the vault of the Queen of England.
 *
 * While Queen Elizabeth has a limited number of types of cake,
 * she has an unlimited supply of each type.
 *
 * Each type of cake has a weight and a value, stored in a tuple with two indices:
 *   An integer representing the weight of the cake in kilograms
 *   An integer representing the monetary value of the cake in British pounds
 *
 * You brought a duffel bag that can hold limited weight,
 * and you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.
 *
 * Write a function max_duffel_bag_value() that takes a list of cake type tuples
 * and a weight capacity, and returns the maximum monetary value the duffel bag can hold.
